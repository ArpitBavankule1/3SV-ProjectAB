# ID Verification System 🔐

This project is developed as part of my internship at **3SV Software Solutions**.
The **ID Verification System** is designed to automate and simplify the process of verifying a user’s identity using government-issued documents. The system ensures data accuracy, reduces manual errors, and enhances security through verification and validation techniques.
